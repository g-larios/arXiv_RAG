Pope's research interests have evolved over time, starting with a focus on W-strings and W-gravity in the early 1990s, then shifting towards supergravity, string theory, M-theory, and black hole physics.\n\nInitially, Pope's work centered on W-algebras and their applications to string theory and gravity [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. He investigated the physical spectra, interactions, and BRST operators of W-strings, exploring higher-spin generalizations of string theory.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, his focus shifted towards supergravity, string theory, and M-theory. He explored p-brane solutions, their classification, and their relation to cosmology [25, 26, 27, 28]. He also investigated discrete states in W-strings and their connection to minimal models.\n\nFrom the late 1990s onwards, Pope's research predominantly explored supergravity, black holes, and related topics. He worked on embedding AdS black holes in higher dimensions [21], consistent sphere reductions of supergravity theories [19, 20, 22, 23], and the construction of new Einstein-Sasaki metrics [17, 18]. He also investigated the thermodynamics of black holes, supersymmetric limits, and topological solitons [16].\n\nIn the 2000s, Pope continued his work on black holes, supergravity, and string theory, studying topics such as AdS/CFT correspondence [15], consistent warped-space Kaluza-Klein reductions [13], and brane-world Kaluza-Klein reductions [12]. He also explored metrics with vanishing quantum corrections [9], time-dependent multi-center solutions [8], and Bohm and Einstein-Sasaki metrics [6].\n\nMore recently, Pope's research has delved into topics such as consistent truncations and dualities [3], generalized dualities and supergroups [2], and perturbations of black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories [1]. He has also investigated the tower of subleading dual BMS charges [5] and the mass of dyonic black holes and entropy super-additivity [4].  His work demonstrates a consistent exploration of the interplay between gravity, string theory, and M-theory, with a particular emphasis on black hole physics and related mathematical structures.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] C.
